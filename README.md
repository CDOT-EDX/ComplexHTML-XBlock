# cdot_slides_for_edx (Still WIP)

HTML XBlock module for edX with the purpose of recording student interaction depending on the staff's requirements.


For CKEditor support, edit "cdot_slides_for_edx/cdot_slides_for_edx/static/js/cdot_slides_for_edx_studio.js" and search for "CKEditor_URL". Note that it will work mostly only for static HTML content (ie no forms and buttons).
